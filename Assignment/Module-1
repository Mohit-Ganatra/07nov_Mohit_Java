Q.1 What is software? What is software engineering? 

--> Software:-
  - It is a collection of computer programs and related data that provide the instructions for 
    telling a computer what to do and how to do it.
  - It is just like human language.
  - 3 main groups depending on their use and application.
      1) System software.
      2) Application software
      3) Programming software
      
--> Software engineering:-     
   - Software engineering is the art of developing quality software on time and within budget.
   - Software Engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, operation,
     and maintenance of a software system.
   - â€•Software engineering is the multi-person construction of multi-version software.

Q.2 Explain types of software.

--> Types of Software:-
   - There are 3 types of software.
      1. System Software
      2. Applicaton software
      3. Programming software
      
  -->  1. System Software
      - System software provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps run the computer 
      hardware and system.
      
      2. Applicaton software
      - Application software is the general designation of computer programs performing user tasks.
          -> Mobile App:
             Application that runs on mobile platform. Example: Instagram app,
          -> Desktop App:
             Application that runs stand-alone in a desktop or laptop computer. 
             Example: Microsoft Word, Web Browser.
          -> Web App:
             Apps that run on a web browser(Mozilla, Google Chrome etc.)
      
      3. Programming Software
      - Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the 
        source code of computer programs. This source code is written in a programming language. 
        The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behavior.

Q.3  What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
-->  SDLC:-
    - The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes 
      for creating high-quality software.
    - The SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:
        1. Requirement Gathering
        2. Analysis
        3. Designing
        4. Implementation
        5. Testing
        6. Maintenance
